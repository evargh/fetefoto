media 
the presentation can be similar to digikam, but without all of the photo editing hooks
databases:
    organize tags heirarchically--we don't need strict relational guarantees

for now, focus on good heirarchical tagging systems, and tag search from CLI. similar to beets, instead of forcing tags to be written to file metadata, make it stored in the database and make it an option to write tags

first task: write a cli that uses a key/value store (based on image data hash) to retrieve tags
